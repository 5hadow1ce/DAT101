      <li>What is an array? A short and concise answer is expected here!</li>
      <p> An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements. They are like a list of variables, but they are stored in a single variable. </p>
      <li>What does it mean to "hardcode" when we talk about programming? (In English, it's called "hard
        coding", "hard-coding", or "hardcoding").</li>
      <p> That is when you embed data in such a way that it is difficult to change and is not obtained from an external source. </p>
      <li>Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we
        (humans) don't "know" how long the array is</li>
      <p> with properties like length, we can iterate through the array without knowing the length of the array. The code demonstrates how to split a string into an array of words and iterate over that array to process each word individually. </p>
      <li>Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4</li>
      <p> It is beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays because it allows you to store multiple instances of the same class in a single variable. </p>
      <li>Try your best to explain the EWeekDays object from task 7. How do we use the "value" attribute, for
        example? In what way do "WeekDay", "Workdays", and "Weekends" differ from each other? If we
        wanted to create a new element "WorkoutDays", which would contain "Monday", "Wednesday", and
        "Thursday", how would it ideally look? (I will choose the best answer to this task and reward it with
        pizza in the cafeteria right after New Year. Remember to mark in your submission if you want to
        participate in the competition!)</li>
      <p> The EWeekDays object uses the value attribute to create a value that represents each day of the week, then we use that value to define the Workdays and Weekends. The difference between WeekDay, Workdays, and Weekends is that WeekDay is the value of the day of the week, Workdays are the days of the week that are considered workdays, and Weekends are the days of the week that are considered weekends. To create a new element "WorkoutDays" that contains "Monday", "Wednesday", and "Thursday", it would ideally look like this: WorkoutDays: { value: 0x01 + 0x04 +0x08, name: "Workout Days" } </p>
      <li>In task 8, we will use a "callback" routine when sorting. Explain how such a "callback" routine works</li>
      <p>in task 8 we used a callback routine when sorting to define the order in which the elements are sorted. The callback routine is a function that is passed as an argument to the sort method and is used to define the order in which the elements are sorted. </p>
      <li>What happens in the sorting routines you have created? Try to explain how the array can figure out
        if an element should come before or after another. The best way to answer this is to actually print
        both parameters each time the sorting routine runs.</li>
      <p> The sorting routines I have created use a callback routine to define the order in which the elements are sorted. The callback routine compares two elements and returns a value that indicates whether the first element should come before or after the second element. The array uses this value to determine the order in which the elements are sorted. </p>
      <li>In task 10, we will create an array with rows and columns. Explain what the first element of the array
        contains</li>
      <p> The first element of the array contains an array of numbers that represent the first row of the matrix. </p>
