      <li>Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?</li>
      <p>Object-oriented development is important in programming because it allows for the creation of reusable code, which can save time and resources. It also makes it easier to manage complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces. Additionally, object-oriented development encourages good design practices, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which can lead to more maintainable and scalable code.</p>
      <li>In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and
how this type of object can help us in software development</li>
      <p>The "AccountType" object is used to define the different types of accounts that can be created in the banking system. By creating a static object for "AccountType," we can easily reference and reuse the different account types throughout the codebase without having to redefine them each time. This type of object helps us in software development by promoting code reusability, consistency, and maintainability. It also allows us to easily add new account types or modify existing ones without having to make changes in multiple places.</p>
      <li>Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class?
        Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function</li>
      <p>We use encapsulation in classes to hide the internal implementation details of a class from the outside world. By encapsulating the data and behavior of a class within its own scope, we can prevent external code from directly accessing or modifying the internal state of the class. This helps to protect the integrity of the class and ensures that its internal state remains consistent and valid.</p>
      <li>Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.</li>
      <p>When we use the "new" command in JavaScript, it creates a new instance of a class or constructor function. The "new" command allocates memory for the new instance, sets up a link between the new instance and its prototype, and calls the constructor function to initialize the new instance. The "new" command returns the newly created instance, which can then be used to access the properties and methods of the class.</p>
