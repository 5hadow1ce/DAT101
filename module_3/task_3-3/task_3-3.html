      <li> What is the difference between invoking and creating a function?</li>
      <p> Invoking a function is calling the function and executing the code inside it. Creating a function is defining the function and writing the code that will be executed when the function is called. </p>

      <li>Explain the syntax regarding semicolons and code blocks.</li>
      <p> Semicolons are used to separate statements in JavaScript. They are optional, but it is recommended to use them to avoid errors. Code blocks are used to group statements together. They are defined by curly braces and can be used in loops, conditionals, and functions. </p>

      <li>What happens when we try to store values from a function when it doesn't return any?</li>
      <p> If a function does not return a value, the variable that stores the result of the function will be undefined. This is most likely because the valuable is local </p>

      <li>How do we separate parameters from each other when creating a function?</li>
      <p> Parameters are separated by commas when creating a function. </p>

      <li>Explain how parameter names are related during the invocation and creation of a function.</li>
      <p> When creating a function, the parameter names are used to define the function. When invoking the function, the parameter names are used to pass arguments to the function. </p>

      <li>Explain why a parameter is undefined when a function call is missing a parameter.</li>
      <p> If a function call is missing a parameter, the parameter will be undefined because the function is expecting a value to be passed to it. </p>

      <li>Explain what happens when we use recursive functions.</li>
      <p> Recursive functions are functions that call themselves. They are used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller problems. When a recursive function is called, it will continue to call itself until a base case is reached. </p>
