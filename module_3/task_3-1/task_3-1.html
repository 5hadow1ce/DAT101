      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>when the wake-up time is not 7 the code put puts that you misses the buss and when it's exactly 7 it outputs that you are on time</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. However, the answer should now be different. Discuss the behaviour of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>what happens is that the code continues to the else if statement to check if that matches and output the correct response to what time it is. when it's exactly 7 it uses the if statement that is true and skips the else ifs </p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p> when the wake time is less than 7 it outputs that you can take the buss, when its grater than 8 you need to take the car</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>when the number is exactly 0 it out put nothing, but when added it outputs as zero</p>
