      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				if a varuble is going to be changed in the future, it should be a variable. If it is not going to be changed, it should be a constant. They can all be constants, but it is not recommended.
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				parentheses are used to group expressions. The expression inside the parentheses is calculated first.
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				you can use the toFixed() method to limit the number of decimals. or you can use the Math.round() method to round the number to the nearest whole number. or you can use the Math.floor()/ Math.ceil() method to round the number down to the nearest whole number.
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				we compare two floating-point values by using ===. 12.199999 is not the same as 12.2.
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				comparison operators return a boolean value. you can check if they are FALSE or TRUE by using the if statement or <, >, <=, >=, ==, ===, !=, !==.
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				Math.random() returns a random number between 0 and 1. it can be used to generate random numbers.
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				modulus (%) is the remainder of a division. we need this operator when we want to know the remainder of a division.
